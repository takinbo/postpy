# PostPy #

PostPy is a python script that I wrote several years ago to scrape the postal code information on the [Nigeria Postcodes](http://nigeriapostcodes.com/) website. The output of this script is published at https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1SGciXyeSfToE565mmlWXFGF005lQWcx0XBBbqw

It hasn't been tested recently and it may be broken. I'm releasing the source code so it can be improved upon so please fork the project and submit pull requests.

### Dependencies ###
